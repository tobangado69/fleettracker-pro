## 📝 Implementation Notes

### Discoveries
- Existing GORM models are well-structured for repository pattern
- Authentication system provides good patterns for data access
- PostgreSQL optimization already configured for mobile GPS data
- Indonesian field validation patterns from existing models

### Dependencies
- GORM already configured in existing codebase
- Database connection and models already working
- Authentication system provides user context patterns
- Existing middleware provides company isolation patterns

### Reusable Patterns
- Service/Handler pattern from authentication implementation
- Company-based filtering from existing middleware
- Error handling patterns from existing handlers
- Indonesian validation patterns from existing models
