## üéØ Problem Statement

FleetTracker Pro needs a comprehensive authentication system to secure the SaaS platform, manage user access, and provide role-based permissions for Indonesian fleet management companies. The system must handle user registration, login, password management, JWT token generation, and role-based access control (RBAC) for different user types (company admins, fleet managers, drivers).

**Target Users**:
- Company administrators who need full access to all features
- Fleet managers who need access to vehicle and driver management
- Drivers who need access to mobile GPS tracking and trip management
- System administrators who need access to analytics and reporting
- API clients that need secure access to backend services

users (
    id, company_id, username, email, password_hash,
    first_name, last_name, phone_number, role,
    is_active, is_verified, last_login, failed_login_attempts,
    locked_until, created_at, updated_at, deleted_at
)

user_sessions (
    id, user_id, access_token_hash, refresh_token_hash,
    expires_at, created_at, last_accessed_at
)

-- Password Reset Tokens
password_reset_tokens (
    id, user_id, token_hash, expires_at, used_at, created_at
)

-- Audit Logs (security events)
audit_logs (
