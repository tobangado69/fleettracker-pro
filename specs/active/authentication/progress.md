## üìù Implementation Notes

### Discoveries
- Existing User model needs authentication fields enhancement
- JWT implementation requires additional dependencies
- Redis integration needed for session management
- Indonesian field validation patterns from vehicle/driver management

### Dependencies
- JWT library: `github.com/golang-jwt/jwt/v5`
- bcrypt for password hashing: Built into Go standard library
- Redis client already configured in existing codebase
- Existing middleware patterns from vehicle/driver management

### Reusable Patterns
- Service/Handler pattern from vehicle/driver/tracking implementations
- Validation patterns from existing models
- Error handling patterns from existing handlers
- Company-based authorization patterns from existing middleware
