## üéØ Problem Statement

FleetTracker Pro needs a comprehensive authentication system to secure the SaaS platform, manage user access, and provide role-based permissions for Indonesian fleet management companies. The system must handle user registration, login, password management, JWT token generation, and role-based access control (RBAC) for different user types (company admins, fleet managers, drivers).

**Target Users**:
- Company administrators who need full access to all features
- Fleet managers who need access to vehicle and driver management
- Drivers who need access to mobile GPS tracking and trip management
- System administrators who need access to analytics and reporting
- API clients that need secure access to backend services

## üìã Requirements

### Core Authentication Features
1. **User Registration and Management** (UPDATED - Enhanced Security)

       - Can create ANY role (super-admin, owner, admin, operator, driver)
       - Can create users in ANY company (cross-company creation)
       - Example: Super-admin creates admin for Company A, driver for Company B
     * `owner` - Company owner (company-bound)
       - Can create: admin, operator, driver
       - Can ONLY create users in OWN company
     * `admin` - Client admin (company-bound)
       - Can create: operator, driver
       - Can ONLY create users in OWN company
     * `operator` - Regular user, cannot create users
     * `driver` - Mobile app user, cannot create users
   - Indonesian field validation (NPWP, phone numbers, addresses)
   - Email verification and account activation
   - User profile management and updates (self-service)
   - Account deactivation (admin-only)

       - Can create owner for Company A
       - Can create admin for Company B
       - Can create driver for Company C
       - Cross-company user creation allowed
     * `owner` ‚Üí Can create: admin, operator, driver
       - Can ONLY create users in OWN company (company-bound)
     * `admin` ‚Üí Can create: operator, driver
       - Can ONLY create users in OWN company (company-bound)
     * `operator` ‚Üí Cannot create users
     * `driver` ‚Üí Cannot create users
   - **Permission-based access control** with role inheritance
   - **Company-based data isolation** (strict multi-tenancy for non-super-admin)
   - **Cross-company creation** (super-admin only)
   - **Role assignment validation** (prevent privilege escalation)
   - **Audit trail** for all role changes

5. **Security Features**

## üìù Changelog

### 2025-10-08 (Update 3) - Session Management Implementation
**Status**: Feature Complete
**Changes**:
- ‚úÖ **Session Management Implemented**: Get active sessions and revoke sessions
  * `GET /api/v1/auth/sessions` - List all active sessions for user
  * `DELETE /api/v1/auth/sessions/:id` - Revoke specific session
  * Shows: user_agent, IP address, created_at, is_current flag
- ‚úÖ **Service Layer**: Created `session_service.go` (138 lines)
  * `GetActiveSessions()` - Retrieve active sessions
  * `RevokeSession()` - Revoke single session
  * `RevokeAllSessions()` - Revoke all except current
  * `CleanupExpiredSessions()` - Background cleanup job
- ‚úÖ **Handler Layer**: Updated `handler.go` with implementations
- ‚úÖ **Security Features**:
  * Users can only manage their own sessions
  * Current session marked with `is_current: true`
  * Redis cache invalidation on revoke
  * Expired session cleanup

**Rationale**:
- Enhances account security (users can see active logins)
- Allows users to revoke suspicious sessions
- Provides visibility into active devices/locations
- Aligns with security best practices (Google, Facebook model)

**Implementation**:
- **New File**: `backend/internal/auth/session_service.go` (138 lines)
- **Modified**: `backend/internal/auth/handler.go` (2 handlers updated)
- **Build Status**: ‚úÖ Successful
- **Time**: 30 minutes

**Next Priority**: Update Swagger documentation

### 2025-10-08 (Update 2) - Super-Admin Cross-Company Creation
**Status**: Requirements Refined
**Changes**:
- üîí **Super-Admin Cross-Company Access**: Super-admin can create users in ANY company
  * Super-admin creates owner for Company A ‚úÖ
  * Super-admin creates admin for Company B ‚úÖ
  * Super-admin creates driver for Company C ‚úÖ
  * Example use case: Platform support team onboarding new companies
- üîí **Owner/Admin Company-Bound**: Can only create users in their OWN company
  * Owner A creates admin in Company A ‚úÖ
  * Owner A creates driver in Company B ‚ùå BLOCKED
- üîí **company_id Parameter**: 
  * Super-admin: Can specify `company_id` in request
  * Owner/Admin: `company_id` automatically set to their company (ignore request parameter)

**Rationale**:
- Super-admin needs cross-company access for platform management
- Enables super-admin to onboard new companies
- Allows super-admin to create initial users for any company
- Owner/Admin remain strictly company-bound for security

**Implementation Impact**:
- ‚úÖ **ALREADY IMPLEMENTED**: `CreateUser()` service has this logic
- ‚úÖ **Lines 84-90** in `user_service.go` check super-admin role
- ‚úÖ **Validation**: Only super-admin can specify `company_id` in request
- ‚úÖ **Security**: Owner/Admin attempts to override `company_id` return 403 Forbidden
- ‚úÖ **Working**: Super-admin can create admin for Company A, driver for Company B

**Code Verification**:
```go
// backend/internal/auth/user_service.go:84-90
if req.CompanyID != "" {
    // Only super-admin can create users in other companies
    if creatorRole != RoleSuperAdmin {
        return nil, apperrors.NewForbiddenError("Only super-admin can create users in other companies")
    }
    companyID = req.CompanyID
}
```

**Status**: ‚úÖ No additional implementation needed - feature already works!

### 2025-01-08 (Update 1) - Enhanced Security Model (SaaS Multi-Tenant)
**Status**: Updated for stricter SaaS security
**Changes**:
- üîí **Restricted Public Registration**: `/auth/register` now only for company owner (first user)
- üîí **Admin-Only User Creation**: New `/users` endpoints for creating additional users
- üîí **Role Hierarchy Enforcement**:
  * super-admin can create all roles in ANY company
  * owner can create admin/operator/driver in OWN company
  * admin can create operator/driver in OWN company
  * operator/driver cannot create users
- üîí **Privilege Escalation Prevention**: Users cannot assign roles higher than their own
- üîí **Company Isolation**: Owner/Admin can only manage users within their company
- üìù **Audit Trail**: All user creation/role changes logged

**Rationale**:
- Prevents unauthorized user creation in SaaS environment
- Ensures company admins control their user base
- Prevents security vulnerabilities from open registration
- Aligns with enterprise SaaS best practices (Salesforce, HubSpot model)

**Implementation Impact**:
- **Breaking Change**: Public `/auth/register` restricted to first user only
- **New Endpoints**: `/users/*` for user management (admin-protected)
- **New Middleware**: Role hierarchy validation
- **New Business Logic**: Prevent privilege escalation
- **Estimated Implementation**: 4-6 hours (COMPLETED)

**Next Priority**: Implement role hierarchy validation and user management endpoints (COMPLETED)
