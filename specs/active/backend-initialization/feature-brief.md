# Feature Brief: Backend Initialization
**Task ID**: `backend-initialization`  
**Created**: January 2025  
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED - Core Infrastructure Ready  
**Assignee**: Backend Team  

## üéØ Problem Statement

**What**: Need to initialize the Go backend infrastructure for FleetTracker Pro, a comprehensive driver tracking SaaS application for Indonesian fleet management companies.

**Who**: Indonesian logistics companies (50-500 vehicles), fleet managers, and operations directors who need real-time GPS tracking, driver behavior monitoring, and operational efficiency.

**Why**: Current Indonesian fleet management market lacks integrated solutions with local payment systems (QRIS), Indonesian language support, and compliance with local regulations. Existing solutions are either too expensive or lack Indonesian-specific features.

**Success**: A robust, scalable Go backend that can handle 1000+ concurrent vehicles, process GPS data in real-time, integrate with Indonesian payment systems, and provide comprehensive fleet management APIs.
